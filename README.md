## Mastering Power BI &amp; DAX  I study DAX daily to enhance my Power BI skills, focusing on advanced calculations, time intelligence, and data modeling. My goal is to share my knowledge through tutorials and examples to help others master DAX. Stay tuned!

#Lets get started

#Concept:-Measures

A measure is simply a DAX formula that instructs Power BI to do a calculation on data. In a sense, a measure is a lot like a formula in a cell in Excel. The main difference between a formula in a cell in Excel and a measure is that a measure always operates over the entire data model, not over just a few cells in a spreadsheet.
